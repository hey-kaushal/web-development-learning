        It is a container used to group together block-level elements or other content.

<!-- 
    2️⃣ <span> — Inline element
        It is a container used to group together inline elements or text.
        
        It does not start on a new line; it stays in line with the surrounding text.
        
        Often used to style part of the text (like a word or phrase). -->

<!-- "semantic" means:
using tags (elements) that clearly describe their meaning — both to the browser and to developers.

Examples of semantic tags:
<header> — defines a page header

<nav> — defines navigation links

<main> — defines the main content

<section> — defines a section of content

<article> — defines an article or blog post

<footer> — defines a footer

<aside> — defines side content

Examples of non-semantic tags:
<div> — just a container, no meaning

<span> — inline container, no meaning -->

    <!-- An HTML Entity is a special code used in HTML to display characters that are reserved in HTML or not easily typed on the keyboard.
    Why do we use HTML entities?
    To display reserved characters
    Example:
    You cannot directly use < and > because HTML thinks they are tags.
    So you write &lt; and &gt;.
    &nbsp; 

    To display special symbols
    Example:
    &copy; → ©
    &euro; → €
    &hearts; → ♥ -->
